Test Driven Development

Follow the below steps to setup your environment:

## node Modules
`npm install`

#### This will install all the gulp related dependencies, I faced issue with 
`gulp-plumber` 
#### and solved it by installing 
`npm install gulp-plumber --save-dev`

## phpSpec etc.
`composer install`

### This went smooth for me.

if gulpfile is having issues, try running phpspec

In your CLI,

`vendor/bin/phpspec run`
